        <h2>This is SF Home Recepies</h2>
        <br>
        <p>We started this project with the aim to improve on the <strong>health and wellbeing</strong> of Nordic citizens.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With this goal in mind we set out to create an app that would do just that. Now this is a hard thing to do, especially given that we had no prior experience with neither front- or backend programming. or appdevelopment.</p>
        <p>Inspired by Wikipedia, we saw that a common health issue, especially when it comes to our generation - students - is that, while there are different websites that provides with a diverse collection of recepies,</p>
        <p>it's still quite difficult to navigate the swamp of input that arises. And who even buys a cooking book?!</p>
        <br>
        <p>That's why we created SF Home Recepies. It strives to be an open collection of different recepies, available to anyone to <strong>share, explore, discover and collect</strong>.</p>
        <p>No strings attatched. No ads back-agenda to proffit. Just people sharing their recepies.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
